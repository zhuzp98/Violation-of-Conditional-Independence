# Violation-of-Conditional-Independence

Conditional independence is defined that the occurrence of A and the occurrence of B are independent in their conditional probability distribution given some event C. That means, given the information of C, the observation of A will provide no information about the occurrence of B, and the observation of B will not reveal anything about A neither.
Generally, the conditional independence assumption is the base of Bayesian models. However, real cases differ in that the input variables may not meet such an assumption, or the conditional independence is weak. We would like to check the potential damage to the model when the input variable can not hold the conditional independence assumption well.
